# particleDistributions
A toolbox for creating distributional figures from particle tracking simulations using OpenDrift.

The following calculations needs to be added:

- [ ] Sedimentation maps that correctly calculates the sedimentation timestamp based on the distance from bottom depth and the average movement of the particle over the last 2 hours. Sedimentation maps needs to be created for each week of the year combining all polygons. Should include all particle types that have sedimented.

- [ ] Create TIFF files from the sedimentation maps (for import to ARCGIS)

- [ ] Calculate statistics for each polygon - a histogram showing percentages of particles that have sedimented for each particle type and the distance sedimented from polygon.

- [ ] Finish the vertical profile plot for individual particle sizes combining all polygons, and removing the data after particle has sedimented.

- [ ] The sedimentation function should take distance from bottom and maximum movement over X hours as input to determine when sedimentation occurss to make it more generic.

- [ ] Calculate the probability that kelp from a given polygon is sedimented at depth deeper than X meters.


### How to run the script on Windows 
calculateAreaAverages.py uses several non standard python packages and it is a bit treaky to download them properly on windows. 

* ogr (part of GDAL - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal)

  Create virtual conda environment and download gdal
  
  conda create -n GDAL python=3.6 gdal
  
  Fra <https://github.com/conda-forge/gdal-feedstock/issues/175> 

* Other packages you should download with conda-forge:

    conda install -c conda-forge 
    
    conda install basemapÂ 
    
    conda install basemap-data-hires
    
    conda install matplotlib
    
    conda install scipy 
    
* Last, download netcd4 package using pip,not conda. Otherwise it won't wok.

  Pip install netcdf4  (not conda,important)
